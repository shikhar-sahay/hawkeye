# HawkEye v2 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - Vercel + Supabase migration (branch: migrate/vercel-supabase)

### Added
- Supabase schema migration (`supabase/migrations/0001_schema.sql`,
  generated from SQLModel metadata) and hand-written RLS/publication
  migration (`0002_realtime_rls.sql`): source-scoped SELECT on the three
  streamed tables, deny-all elsewhere, `supabase_realtime` publication,
  `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on alerts/incidents.
- `POST /api/v1/realtime-token`: mints short-lived, source-scoped Realtime
  JWTs from a validated HawkEye API key (server-derived `source_id`,
  uninfluencable by callers).
- `api/index.py`: Vercel serverless entrypoint exporting the FastAPI app
  natively (no adapter); lifespan skips DDL/heartbeat under
  `HAWKEYE_SKIP_CREATE_ALL` / `HAWKEYE_DISABLE_HEARTBEAT`.
- Frontend `SupabaseRealtimeProvider` behind env flag, same context
  contract; legacy raw-WebSocket path preserved for local dev.
- Root `vercel.json` (monorepo: frontend build + `/api/*` + `/health` to
  function, SPA fallback); `.python-version` pins 3.12.

### Changed
- Batch ingestion cap 1000 to 50 (measured superlinear cost: 1.78s/50 and
  8.26s/100 locally; Supabase RTT would breach the 10s serverless timeout).
  Backfills chunk client-side.
- Small serverless-safe DB pool settings (`DB_POOL_SIZE`,
  `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `DB_PREPARED_STATEMENT_CACHE_SIZE`).

### Fixed
- (this session) see Tests below; no production deployment yet.

### Tests
- 7 RLS isolation tests (negative-heavy, require `HAWKEYE_TEST_PG_URL`).
- 8 realtime-token tests incl. token-to-RLS claim contract.
- 6 Vercel entrypoint tests (full API surface, detection pipeline, batch
  envelope, lifespan flags).
- Suite total 61 passing (54 always + 7 RLS with PG).

## [Unreleased] - Live WebSocket event delivery fix (2026-09-05)

### Fixed
- **P0: live event broadcasts never reached any subscriber.** Two stacked
  bugs, both silent: (1) `broadcast_custom("event", ...)` used the wire
  message type as the subscription filter, but subscribers use `"events"`
  (plural), so every event broadcast matched zero connections; (2)
  `_broadcast_event` read `normalized.created_at`, which does not exist on
  the model (`AttributeError`), and the bare `except: pass` swallowed it.
  Fixed by decoupling message type from subscription bucket (new
  `subscription_type` parameter), mapping `created_at` from `timestamp`
  (same convention as the REST mapper), and logging broadcast failures
  loudly instead of swallowing them. 4 regression tests in
  `TestBroadcastSubscriptionRouting`.
- Verified live on real PostgreSQL 16: ingest returns 202, the event row
  arrives over WS with type `event`, and 6 rapid failures produce live
  `alert` + `incident` broadcasts; dashboard Events page updates without
  refresh.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - Security hardening and production release (2026-09-05)

### Fixed
- **P0: cross-source IDOR on the management plane.** Any valid key could
  read, modify, deactivate, or delete ANY source, and list, mint, modify, or
  revoke ANY source's API keys (full impersonation + wipe + auth DoS). New
  `require_source_ownership` dependency (404 on mismatch, no existence
  oracle) now guards source detail/update/delete and all key endpoints; key
  minting keeps a narrow onboarding carve-out (first key of a keyless source
  only). Data-plane endpoints were already correctly scoped. 4 regression
  tests in `tests/test_source_ownership.py`.
- **P1: API key expiry was accepted but never enforced.** Expired keys now
  get 401 (`API key expired`) on REST and 1008 rejection on WebSocket.
  3 tests in `tests/test_key_expiry.py`.
- **P1: ingestion 500s echoed raw exception text** (DB internals). Production
  responses are now generic; full tracebacks stay in server logs; dev keeps
  detail for SDK authors.

### Changed
- `docs/deployment.md`: Starter-plan requirement (no sleeping), fresh-DB +
  `create_all` strategy, immediate-bootstrap lockdown check, no-seed-prod
  rule, ownership model, WebSocket transport decisions, extended checklist.
- `docs/USER_MANUAL.md`: never seed production.
- Removed accidentally committed `frontend/vite.config.d.ts` build artifact.

---

## [Unreleased] - Migration-readiness audit fixes (2026-09-05)

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL blocker**: incident `search` / `affected_ip` / `affected_user`
  filters used `ILIKE` directly on JSON columns, which PostgreSQL rejects
  (`jsonb` has no `~~*` operator). Filters now `CAST` to `VARCHAR` first -
  verified compiling on both dialects and live on SQLite.
- **PostgreSQL blocker**: `asyncpg` was not installed nor declared, so any
  `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...` would crash at startup. Added to
  `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.
- Login backend-unreachable message no longer references `port 8000`.
- Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` honors `$PORT` instead of hardcoded 8000.
- `scripts/seed_demo_data.py` and `scripts/cleanup_test_sources.py` refuse
  to run with `ENVIRONMENT=production` unless `--force` is passed (the seed
  script embeds a publicly known demo API key).
- Corrected the `VITE_WS_URL` code comment (bare origin; `/ws` is appended
  by the code), matching `.env.production.example` and `docs/deployment.md`.

---

## [2.9.2] - 2026-08-26 - Dialog Width Fix, Side-List Layout, Refresh/Search UX, Deployment Prep

### Fixed
- **Every dialog was silently capped at 512px**: `DialogContent`/`AlertDialogContent`
  base classes contained both `max-w-lg` and `sm:max-w-lg`; tailwind-merge
  cannot override the `sm:` variant, so callers' `max-w-2xl/4xl/5xl` never
  applied (clipped tabs, badges, and content in the alert/incident/event
  detail dialogs). The duplicate was removed and mobile width made explicit
  (`w-[calc(100%-2rem)] sm:w-full`).
- **Event detail preview widened**: `max-w-2xl` → `md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-4xl`
  (896px on desktop) with internal scrolling preserved.
- **Alerts/Incidents side lists were cramped/cropped**: the 620px-min tables
  sat in a 1fr grid column that shrank to ~213px at 1280-1440 viewports.
  Grid rebalanced to 3/5 + 2/5 with `min-w-0` guards; secondary columns
  (type/status/time) now appear at `xl`/`2xl` so rows fit their column;
  overflow stays contained inside the card.
- Footer docs link and sitemap/robots no longer reference localhost.

### Added
- **Dashboard manual Refresh button**: invalidates all dashboard queries
  (real network refetch, verified 8 requests), spinner while any dashboard
  query is in flight, disabled while refreshing, success/error toast.
- **Global search resets on page navigation** (pathname-level effect in
  TopNav; query-string navigation unaffected).
- **Deployment preparation** (see `docs/deployment.md`):
  - `frontend/vercel.json` (Vite SPA rewrites, asset caching) and
    `frontend/.env.production.example`.
  - Configurable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` / `VITE_WS_URL` (default same-origin);
    typed in `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - `render.yaml` blueprint for the v2 backend (single worker, health check,
    generated secrets) and a root `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore`.
  - `requirements.txt` regenerated for the v2 stack (was legacy Flask pins);
    stale root `package.json` and duplicate `frontend/vite.config.js` removed.
  - **Legacy v1 preserved**: annotated tag `legacy-v1-flask` (pushed) plus an
    in-tree `legacy-v1/README.md` explaining status and recovery. The old
    Render service is deliberately left untouched until the v2 deployment is
    verified.

### Verification
- Backend 36/36 tests; tsc clean; ESLint 0 errors; production build passes.
- Browser-verified: alert detail 896px with all tabs visible (was 512px,
  clipped), event detail 896px, incident detail 1024px, side lists visible
  and readable at 1024-1920 with zero page overflow, dashboard refresh fires
  8 real requests with spinner + toast, every page's Refresh performs a real
  fetch, search resets on navigation (sidebar, result click, back/forward),
  dev flow unchanged with env vars unset.

---

## [2.9.1] - 2026-08-26 - Fresh-Install Bootstrap and Login Error Fixes

### Fixed
- **Fresh installs could never mint their first credential** (login blocker):
  `POST /sources/{id}/api-keys` required an existing API key, but a fresh
  deployment only has a bootstrap-registered source with no key. The endpoint
  is now open while the deployment has zero API keys
  (`require_source_for_key_creation` dependency), closing the deadlock; the
  documented register-source → create-key → sign-in flow works end to end.
- **Login showed "Unknown error" when the backend was down**: the Vite dev
  proxy answers with a 500 whose body is plain text, defeating JSON error
  extraction. The API client now falls back to status-based messages, and
  5xx responses surface "Could not reach the Hawkeye backend..." (login also
  keeps the entered key on 5xx, so retrying after starting the server
  succeeds without retyping it).
- Get Started step 3 no longer tells users to pass an API key they cannot
  have yet; USER_MANUAL/README/AGENTS bootstrap docs updated to match.

### Added
- `tests/test_bootstrap.py` (3 tests): fresh install can mint the first
  credential, bootstrap closes once a key exists, invalid keys rejected.
  Uses an isolated in-memory SQLite via dependency overrides (both
  `database.get_session` and the `deps.get_session` wrapper).

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-26 - Search Hardening, Dashboard Fixes, Responsive QA, User Manual

### Added
- **DELETE /api/v1/sources/{id}** (backend): the Sources page offered deletion
  but the endpoint did not exist (405). Deletion now permanently removes the
  source with a full cascade (incident-alert join rows, incidents, alerts,
  normalized events, raw events, API keys).
- **Mobile search panel** in the dashboard top bar: the global search was
  hidden below the `sm` breakpoint; a magnifier toggle now opens a full-width
  search panel on phones.
- **docs/USER_MANUAL.md**: complete end-user manual (setup walkthrough from
  empty database to first alert, dashboard guide, detection lifecycle, search
  guide, API/WebSocket reference, configuration, troubleshooting, security
  notes).
- **scripts/cleanup_test_sources.py**: removes empty QA/test sources
  (name-pattern + zero-data guarded; `--dry-run` supported).
- MIT `LICENSE` file (README already claimed MIT).

### Changed
- **Global search hardening** (`TopNav.tsx`): source suggestions now use the
  backend `search` param instead of filtering the first 200 sources
  client-side (correct with large source counts); stale-response race guard
  so slow earlier queries cannot overwrite newer results; explicit error
  state (previously indistinguishable from "no results"); matched text
  highlighted; keyboard selection scrolls into view; Enter opens the
  highlighted suggestion; incident results no longer render "undefined
  alerts" when `alert_count` is null.
- **Stat card semantics** (`StatsDashboard.tsx`): "Active Alerts" now counts
  new + processing + correlated (previously read as 0 while a critical badge
  showed 86); the impossible "Resolved/suppressed" card (statuses that do
  not exist in the backend vocabulary) replaced with "Dismissed Alerts".
- CORS default now allows the Vite dev origin (:5173) instead of the legacy
  Flask v1 port (:5000); `.env.example` updated to match.

### Fixed
- **Performance:** `/sources/event-counts` ran 3 COUNT queries per source
  (~2,700 sequential queries with 1,000+ sources, ~7 s per dashboard load);
  now 3 grouped queries total (~73 ms warm).
- **Data hygiene (DATA-HYGIENE-01):** purged 1,098 empty test sources from
  the dev database via the new cleanup script; 5 seeded demo sources remain.
- Incidents table row chevron was a no-op; it now opens the incident detail
  dialog like the row click.
- Alert feed showed raw "Source: 3" ids; now resolves source names from the
  cached event-counts query ("Source: Web Application").
- Events page header overflowed at 320 px (Export + Refresh + Filters row
  now wraps).
- Mojibake en dashes ("â€“") in the Alerts and Events pagination text.
- `PATCH /sources/{id}/api-keys/{key_id}` was missing the auth dependency;
  all source/key management endpoints now require a valid API key.

### Verification
- Backend tests 33/33; frontend tsc, ESLint (0 errors), and production build
  pass. Browser-verified: search (desktop + 390 px mobile), autocomplete
  keyboard navigation, deep links, alert detail tabs + status actions,
  incident detail, source create/delete via UI, settings persistence, theme
  switching, sidebar collapse/header alignment, sign-out/sign-in flow, and
  zero page-level horizontal overflow at 320/390/768/1280/1440/1920.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-08-25 - FE Polish: Canonical Logo, Landing Scale, Pipeline Signal

### Changed
- **Canonical logo everywhere** — the geometric HawkMark SVG was removed;
  `frontend/public/hawkeyelogo.png` is now the single Hawkeye mark, used in
  the landing header/hero/CTA, observation field, footer, Get Started, 404,
  login, dashboard sidebar/topnav, and the loader. Competing assets deleted
  (favicon.svg, icons.svg); the favicon and the regenerated OG image now use
  the canonical mark. Breathing animation adapted to the raster logo.
- **Landing scale** — hero headline up to 68px, larger body copy, badge,
  CTAs, code block, and a substantially larger observation field; pipeline
  stages use 48px icon nodes with text-lg titles; landing sections widened
  to max-w-7xl with the header content aligned to the same grid. Dashboard
  untouched.
- **Pipeline travelling ping** — a small cyan telemetry signal loops along
  the WATCH → RESPOND connector (8s), pulsing each stage node on arrival;
  a vertical variant follows the stacked mobile layout. Fully disabled under
  prefers-reduced-motion (static rails remain).

### Fixed
- Header content container now matches the landing grid exactly (verified:
  header inner edges equal hero container edges at every width); header
  background/border span the full viewport with no horizontal overflow.
- Zero U+2014 em dashes in frontend content, comments, robots.txt, and
  metadata (36+ occurrences replaced with context-appropriate punctuation;
  dashboard stat placeholders now use "...").
- Reduced-motion: travelling ping explicitly hidden (previously froze
  mid-animation after the global override).

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-25 - Deep Frontend Redesign: Hawkeye Identity, Three Themes, Chart Fixes

### Fixed
- **Alerts Over Time x-axis was wrong for every range** — the chart formatted
  all ticks as `HH:mm`, producing non-chronological hour labels on 7d/30d.
  Ticks are now range-aware: `HH:mm` (24h), `Mon HH:mm` (7d), `Aug 04` (30d),
  with full-precision tooltip timestamps. Backend `/alerts/time-series` now
  buckets by range (hourly / 4-hourly / daily), aligns buckets to the same
  grid as the counts, and fills gaps with zeros so the axis is honest and
  chronological (the previous 7d aggregation dropped all recent alerts).
- **Public mobile header overlapped the logo** (320–430px) and had no mobile
  menu — public pages now share a proper SiteHeader with a focus-managed
  drawer (focus in, Escape closes, focus restore, body scroll lock).
- **Theme flash on load** — anti-FOUC inline script applies the stored theme
  class before first paint.
- **Incident timeline cards clipped at the right edge** (line-clamp
  `-webkit-box` inflated intrinsic width; fixed with inline-size containment)
  and timeline severity glyphs rendered as mojibake (`â–²` → ▲/●).
- **Copy buttons in Get Started failed silently** when the Clipboard API was
  unavailable — now falls back to a textarea and shows explicit Copied/failed
  feedback.
- **Mojibake em-dashes/bullets** across StatsDashboard, TopNav, Settings,
  Events, SourceManager; **stray clipped percentage label** on the Severity
  Distribution donut; **raw enum labels** (`bot_detection`) in the Detection
  Type chart; **light-theme contrast failures** (primary/white 3.81:1 → 5.2:1,
  severity-high 4.0:1 → 4.94:1, warning 3.18:1 → 4.86:1).
- **Zero horizontal overflow at 320–1440px** — fixed min-content blowout in
  the hero grid, event story panels, and dashboard preview (SVG transferred
  aspect-ratio sizes).
- **Mobile drawer rendered inside the 56px header** — the header's
  `backdrop-blur` created a containing block for the fixed overlay; the
  drawer is now a sibling of the header.
- Get Started step 2's key-creation curl was missing its closing quote
  (copy-paste produced a shell syntax error).
- Scroll-reveal no longer hides content from crawlers/print/no-JS (fallbacks
  added for reduced motion, print, and `.noscript`).

### Changed
- **Full landing page redesign around the WATCH → INGEST → DETECT →
  CORRELATE → RESPOND identity**: two-column hero with an animated
  observation field (concentric rings, rotating radar sweep, inbound signal
  streaks, detection blips, telemetry chips, breathing hawk mark), capability
  signal strip, connected 5-stage pipeline rail, "What happens to a single
  failed login" event→alert→incident story using real schema field names,
  interactive detection matrix with the real triggers from
  `hawkeye/config.py` and the real ATT&CK mappings from the correlation
  engine, labeled dashboard preview, 5-question FAQ, hawk-branded CTA.
- **Three-theme system**: Light, Deep Blue (classic), and Pitch Black (true
  black, neutral gray scale, hairline borders) with a restrained animated
  transition; `dark:` variants apply to both dark themes.
- **Get Started redesigned as a five-step onboarding timeline** (Run →
  Register source → Generate key → Send event → Watch detection) with
  breadcrumbs, copyable commands, and a SOURCE → API KEY → EVENT →
  DETECTION → DASHBOARD relationship strip.
- **Hawkeye motion system**: HawkMark SVG component (animated wings/eye),
  HawkLoader, observation-field keyframes — all CSS-only, decorative, and
  disabled under prefers-reduced-motion.
- Login page now uses the standard geometric hawk mark (was a different PNG
  glyph); mobile hero shows the hawk centerpiece above the fold.

### Added
- **Branded 404 page** ("The hawk found nothing here") replacing the silent
  redirect to `/`.
- **Per-route titles and meta descriptions** via `useRouteMeta`; OG/Twitter
  tags, generated OG image, `robots.txt` (dashboard routes disallowed) and
  `sitemap.xml`.
- **Skip-to-content links** and `<main>` landmarks on all public pages and
  the dashboard shell; show-key toggle restored to tab order.
- Mobile sticky CTA (appears after the hero, hides near the footer).
- Per-chart loading states on the dashboard so fast charts no longer wait on
  the slow events-by-source query.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-24 - Visual System, Landing Page & Navigation Overhaul

### Fixed
- **WebSocket status indicator stuck on Connecting/Disconnected** — the provider
  mount effect only connected when the API key CHANGED, so StrictMode remounts
  and HMR closed the socket in cleanup and never reconnected. The effect is now
  idempotent and always ensures a live connection for the current key.
  WebSocket close code 1008 (auth rejection) now surfaces Error status and stops
  pointless reconnect attempts.
- **Duplicate Hawkeye branding when the sidebar collapsed** — header rendered a
  second logo+wordmark next to the collapsed rail's icon. Branding now lives in
  the sidebar at lg+ and in the header only below lg.
- **Mobile navigation drawer did not work** — the overlay existed but never
  controlled the sidebar; the sidebar is now a proper drawer below lg.
- **Sources Refresh gave no feedback** — refetch worked but an unchanged result
  looked like a dead button; refresh now toasts success/failure, disables with a
  spinner while fetching, and shows an updated-time stamp.
- **AlertFeed/IncidentTimeline showed empty state during initial load** instead
  of their (previously unused) loading skeletons.

### Changed
- **Design system rebuilt** — new dark theme with layered blue-slate surfaces,
  new light theme, semantic success/warning/info tokens, and a per-theme severity
  palette (critical/high/medium/low) used consistently across charts, badges,
  tables, timelines, and detail views. Fixed root cause of the Severity
  Distribution legend rendering without colors: it referenced a CSS token that
  never existed.
- Typography scale tightened for information density (page titles, uppercase
  table headers, tabular numerals), themed scrollbars, consistent focus rings,
  global prefers-reduced-motion handling.

### Added
- **Public landing page at `/`** presenting real product capabilities (detection
  engines, MITRE mapping, correlation, WebSocket streaming, source/key model)
  with CSS-only entrance and scroll-reveal animations; dashboard moved to
  `/dashboard`.
- **Get started page (`/get-started`)** documenting the honest path to a
  credential: run instance, bootstrap first source, generate API key, sign in.
  No fake account registration; API-key authentication remains the mechanism.

### Verified
- tsc clean (project-wide), vite build PASS, eslint PASS, backend tests 33/33
- All routes serve via dev server incl. new public pages; WS handshake verified

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-24 - Dashboard Usability, Authentication & Security Hardening

### Fixed
- **TypeScript checking was a no-op** — root `tsconfig.json` had `include: []`, so
  `tsc --noEmit` compiled nothing and ~43 real errors were hidden. Config repaired;
  all errors fixed; `npm run build` now performs a real project-wide typecheck.
- **Alerts page crash** — clicking any alert threw `ReferenceError` (missing
  `selectedAlert` state declaration). Now opens the detail dialog.
- **Detail dialog crashes** — AlertDetail/IncidentDetail used `CardDescription`
  (and `cn`) without importing them; Evidence/MITRE/Actions tabs crashed at render.
- **Unauthenticated source management** — the entire `/sources` router (create,
  update, delete, API-key lifecycle) accepted anonymous requests. All endpoints now
  require a valid API key; `POST /sources` remains open only for first-source
  bootstrap.
- **Secret in bundle** — removed hardcoded demo key from `api/client.ts` and deleted
  `frontend/.env` (`VITE_API_KEY`) which Vite inlined into every build.
- **Broken pagination** — Events/Alerts/Incidents "Load More" replaced results
  instead of appending; replaced with Previous/Next + "Showing X–Y of Z".
- **Incident IP/user filters were no-ops** — backend `affected_ip`/`affected_user`
  params did nothing (`pass`); now implemented.
- **Dead Settings controls** — WebSocket tab showed hardcoded status with a disabled
  button (now live status + working connect/disconnect); "Run Connection Test" and
  reconnect buttons functional; fake "API Endpoint" setting removed.
- **Wrong ingestion paths in API client** — `/events/ingest*` → actual
  `POST /api/v1/events` and `/api/v1/events/batch`.
- **Dashboard honesty** — duplicate/mislabeled "Events Today" KPI replaced with
  Resolved Alerts; "(24h)" labels corrected to all-time totals.

### Added
- **API key sign-in flow** — new `/login` page validating against the backend;
  `RequireAuth` route gate with return-to-page redirects; global 401 handling that
  routes expired keys back to login; Sign Out clears local key.
- **Event detail dialog** — click any event row for full analyst metadata
  (actor/target/MITRE/raw metadata JSON).
- **Deep links** — `/events?event=N`, `/alerts?alert=N`,
  `/incidents?incident=N`, `/sources?source=N` open the matching entity; global
  search and notifications navigate via these (previously dead routes).

### Changed
- Search on Alerts/Incidents/Sources is now server-side (debounced), consistent
  with Events and TopNav search.
- Sources list supports `is_active` filter param; SourceManager uses server-side
  filtering/pagination throughout.
- Notifications deduplicated by entity id, respect the enable/disable setting,
  and no longer flash "new" highlights on initial load.
- Auto-refresh interval on Dashboard comes from Settings; notification bell honors
  its enable toggle.
- Settings tabs driven by `?tab=` query param (Profile/Security menu links work).

### Verified
- Backend tests: ✅ 33/33 PASS
- Frontend: ✅ tsc clean (real check), vite build PASS, eslint PASS
- Runtime: all routes 200 incl. /login; API + WS verified through Vite proxy;
  auth matrix exercised (401 without key / 200 with key)
- E2E pipeline: batch ingest → brute-force detection → alert broadcast received
  over WebSocket
- Built bundle scanned: no API-key material present

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-24 - DASH-POLISH-01: Issues 3–7 (Dashboard Polish Completion)

### Added
- **ISSUE-3: Dashboard Time-Range Controls** — 24h/7d/30d badges on the Alerts Over Time chart are now clickable buttons; selecting a range updates state and refetches chart data (`frontend/src/components/StatsDashboard.tsx`)
- **ISSUE-4: Global Search Autocomplete** — TopNav search performs debounced (250 ms) parallel queries across events, alerts, incidents, and sources with dropdown results and keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Escape); backend `search` query param added to alerts, incidents, and sources list endpoints
- **ISSUE-5: Notification Bell** — Bell icon now shows recent high-severity (critical/high) alerts/incidents received over the shared WebSocket, with badge count, timestamps, click-to-navigate, and clear-all
- **ISSUE-6: Functional User Menu** — Profile navigates to Settings, Security Settings opens the API tab, Sign Out clears the stored API key and reloads

### Fixed
- **WebSocket flickering root cause** — `WebSocketContext` lifecycle: split `disconnect()` vs `cleanupDisconnect()` so StrictMode unmount/remount no longer tears down and reconnects the connection; removed unnecessary effect dependencies; session/last-event-id tracked in refs to avoid stale closures
- **Vite WebSocket proxy** — Added `changeOrigin: true` to the `/ws` proxy config

### Changed
- **ISSUE-7: UX polish** — Consistent loading/empty/error states across pages
- **browser-agent/** — Restructured from `src/` layout to flat layout (`background/`, `content/`, `shared/`); updated manifest, tsconfig, and Vite config accordingly

### Documentation
- Rewrote `README.md` (was two concatenated documents with contradictory status)
- Replaced duplicate handbook in `CLAUDE.md` with pointer to `AGENTS.md`
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to current architecture (single shared WebSocket, M3/M3.5 complete, browser-agent flat layout, `/alerts/time-series` endpoint name)

### Verified
- Backend tests: ✅ 33/33 PASS (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- Frontend build: ✅ PASS (`npm run build`)
- Frontend lint: ✅ PASS (4 pre-existing fast-refresh warnings)
- Runtime: all SPA routes return 200; `/api` + `/ws` proxies verified against running backend

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-17 - DASH-POLISH-01: WebSocket Consolidation (ISSUE-1)

### Fixed
- **ISSUE-1: WebSocket Indicator Flickering** — Consolidated from TWO independent WebSocket implementations to a SINGLE shared connection
  - **Root Cause**: `useWebSocket.ts` hook created separate connections in AlertsPage, IncidentsPage, EventsPage while `WebSocketContext.tsx` provider created another for TopNav — causing race conditions, flickering, and reconnection storms
  - **Resolution**: Migrated all pages to shared `WebSocketContext` (Context + Provider pattern)
    - `WebSocketProvider` in `AppLayout` wraps entire app with single connection
    - Default subscriptions: `["alerts", "incidents", "events"]`
    - `useWebSocketContext()` hook provides connection status, session management, reconnect/disconnect
    - `useWebSocketMessage()` hook subscribes to specific message types (alert, incident, event)
    - TanStack Query invalidation on real-time message receipt

### Removed
- **`frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`** — Old independent hook implementation (no longer needed)
  - Types moved to `WebSocketContext.tsx` for centralized definition
  - AlertFeed.tsx and IncidentTimeline.tsx updated to import types from WebSocketContext

### Changed
- **`frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx`** — Enhanced as single source of truth
  - Added all WebSocket type definitions (WSMessage, WSClientMessage, AlertPayload, IncidentPayload, EventPayload, ConnectedData, WSErrorData)
  - Exports `useWebSocketContext()`, `useConnectionStatus()`, `useConnectionStatusWithInit()`, `useWebSocketMessage()` hooks
- **`frontend/src/pages/Alerts.tsx`** — Migrated to `useWebSocketContext` + `useWebSocketMessage("alert")`
- **`frontend/src/pages/Incidents.tsx`** — Migrated to `useWebSocketContext` + `useWebSocketMessage("incident")`
- **`frontend/src/pages/Events.tsx`** — Verified already using shared context correctly
- **`frontend/src/components/AlertFeed.tsx`** — Import types from WebSocketContext
- **`frontend/src/components/IncidentTimeline.tsx`** — Import types from WebSocketContext

## [2.4.2] - 2026-08-17 - DASH-POLISH-01: Refresh Buttons Fix (ISSUE-2)

### Fixed
- **ISSUE-2: Refresh Buttons Non-Functional** — Fixed TanStack Query v5 loading state bug across 4 pages
  - **Root Cause**: `isLoading` only true for initial load in TanStack Query v5; `isFetching` needed for refetch operations
  - **Resolution**: Changed all Refresh buttons to use `isFetching` for spinner and disabled state
  - Pages updated: Alerts, Incidents, Events, Sources (SourceManager)

### Changed
- **`frontend/src/pages/Alerts.tsx`** — Added `isFetching` to useQuery, Refresh button uses `isFetching` for spinner/disabled
- **`frontend/src/pages/Incidents.tsx`** — Added `isFetching` to useQuery, Refresh button uses `isFetching` for spinner/disabled
- **`frontend/src/components/SourceManager.tsx`** — Added `isFetching` to useQuery, Refresh button uses `isFetching` for spinner/disabled (uses `Loader2` icon)
- **`frontend/src/pages/Events.tsx`** — Added `isFetching` to useQuery, Refresh button uses `isFetching` for spinner/disabled (consistency)

### Verified
- Frontend build: ✅ PASS (`npm run build`)
- Frontend lint: ✅ PASS (`npm run lint` — only pre-existing warnings)
- Backend tests: ✅ 33/33 PASS (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Refresh buttons now properly show loading spinner and disable during refetch via `isFetching`

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-17 - Dashboard End-to-End Verification & Fixes (T-039)

### Fixed
- **T-039: Dashboard End-to-End Verification** — Fixed Alerts/Incidents "Failed to load" errors and WebSocket disconnection
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend WebSocket implementations were NOT sending the API key for authentication
  - Backend requires API key via: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header, `X-API-Key: <key>` header, or `?api_key=<key>` query param
  - WebSocket in browsers can't easily send custom headers → used query parameter approach
  
- **`frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`** - Added API key as query parameter in WebSocket URL
  ```typescript
  const apiKeyParam = apiKey ? `&api_key=${encodeURIComponent(apiKey)}` : "";
  return `${protocol}//${host}/ws?subscribe=${encodeURIComponent(subscribeParam)}${apiKeyParam}`;
  ```

- **`frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx`** - Added API key as query parameter in WebSocket URL
  ```typescript
  const apiKeyParam = apiKey ? `&api_key=${encodeURIComponent(apiKey)}` : "";
  return `/ws?subscribe=${encodeURIComponent(subscribeParam)}${apiKeyParam}`;
  ```

- **Sources Page Duplicate Heading Fix** — Removed redundant "Sources" page header from `SourceManager.tsx`
  - `Sources.tsx` page provides the page title
  - Preserved Refresh and Add Source controls in SourceManager

### Verified
- Direct API test with demo key: `GET /api/v1/alerts` ✅ Returns seeded data
- Direct API test with demo key: `GET /api/v1/incidents` ✅ Returns seeded data
- Direct WebSocket test: `ws://localhost:8000/ws?subscribe=alerts,incidents&api_key=...` ✅ Connects, authenticates, receives "connected" message with session_id
- Backend tests: 33/33 pass ✅
- Frontend build: Successful ✅
- Frontend lint: Clean ✅

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- `frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SourceManager.tsx`

## [2.2.2] - 2026-07-29 - Documentation Audit & Synchronization + Frontend Polish

### Added
- **T-031: Code-split Chart Components** — Bundle optimization complete
  - `StatsDashboard.tsx`: All 6 chart components wrapped with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` with skeleton fallbacks
  - `vite.config.ts`: Manual chunks for vendor-react, vendor-query, vendor-charts (recharts), vendor-ui, and 6 individual chart chunks
  - Build results: Main chunk 601 KB (gzipped: 171 KB) vs 1.04 MB before; 6 lazy-loaded chart chunks (2-28 KB each); recharts in vendor-charts chunk (350 KB)

### Changed
- **All documentation files synchronized** to match actual repository state
  - `SESSION.md` — Updated milestone progress to ~99%, T-031 complete, next task T-034
  - `ROADMAP.md` — Updated Milestone 3 to ~99%, all 6 pages documented as complete, T-031 marked complete
  - `TODO.md` — T-031 marked complete, T-034 as next optional task, T-030 (pagination) marked complete
  - `CLAUDE.md` — Updated progress %, Events page status, API endpoints list, key files table
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

### Fixed
- **TopNav Search Functionality** (`frontend/src/components/layout/TopNav.tsx`): Added search input that navigates to Events page with search query parameter (Enter key + button click)
- **ConnectionStatusCard Extraction** (`frontend/src/components/ConnectionStatusCard.tsx`): Extracted reusable `ConnectionStatusCard` (full card with session details, reconnect/disconnect buttons) and `ConnectionStatusInline` (compact pill for TopNav) — used by TopNav, EventsPage
- **Events Export Handler** (`frontend/src/pages/Events.tsx`): Verified `handleExport` function works correctly — exports filtered/combined events to CSV with proper headers and timestamp-based filename
- **Settings Placeholder Buttons** (`frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`): All placeholder buttons (GitHub, Security Policy, Documentation, Connection Test, Connection Logs) now properly disabled with `aria-disabled="true"`, `cursor-not-allowed`, and tooltips explaining future availability
- **Dashboard avg_confidence Fix** (`frontend/src/components/StatsDashboard.tsx`): Fixed display bug — backend returns `avg_confidence` as decimal 0.0–1.0, frontend now correctly displays as percentage: `${Math.round(alertStats.avg_confidence * 100)}%`
- **SourceManager Pagination** (`frontend/src/components/SourceManager.tsx`): Already fully implemented with page/pageSize state, server-side pagination via API (`pageSize`, `page * pageSize`), pagination controls (prev/next, page indicator, page size selector)
- **Router Fixes (Visual QA Prep)**:
  - Removed duplicate `<BrowserRouter>` in `App.tsx` — `main.tsx` already wraps `<App />` in `BrowserRouter`; duplicate caused "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>"
  - Removed nested `<BrowserRouter>` in `Settings.tsx` — caused "useRoutes() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component" error

### Verified
- All 33 backend tests pass
- Frontend build succeeds (TypeScript + Vite)
- Frontend lint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Backend lint: 52 style/complexity warnings (no critical errors)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-25 - Integration Blockers Resolved, Backend Production-Ready

### Fixed
- **T-030**: Fixed double route prefix on ingestion endpoints
  - Removed `prefix="/events"` from `hawkeye/api/v1/ingestion.py` router
  - Endpoints now correctly resolve to `/api/v1/events/ingest` and `/api/v1/events/ingest/batch`

- **T-031**: Fixed double route prefix on events query endpoints
  - Removed `prefix="/events"` from `hawkeye/api/v1/events.py` router
  - Endpoints now correctly resolve to `/api/v1/events/query` and `/api/v1/events/{event_id}`

- **T-032**: Added WebSocket header/cookie authentication
  - Modified `get_ws_source` in `hawkeye/api/websocket.py` to support multiple auth methods (priority order):
    1. `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header
    2. `X-API-Key: <api_key>` header
    3. Query parameter: `?api_key=<api_key>` (backward compatibility)
  - Frontend can now securely authenticate without exposing API keys in URLs/logs

- **T-033**: Implemented WebSocket reconnection protocol
  - Added `SessionData` class for session persistence with message history (max 1000 messages)
  - Added `ConnectionManager.reconnect()` method for full reconnection with missed message replay
  - Added `ConnectionManager.resume_session()` for session resumption on existing connection
  - Client protocol: `{"type": "reconnect", "data": {"session_id": "...", "last_event_id": 123}}`
  - Server responds with `connected` confirmation + replays all messages with `event_id > last_event_id`
  - Session TTL: 1 hour (configurable), auto-cleanup in heartbeat loop

### Changed
- Updated `ConnectionInfo` dataclass with `session_id` and `last_event_id` fields for reconnection support
- Heartbeat loop now cleans up expired sessions in addition to stale connections
- WebSocket `/ws` endpoint docstring updated with full protocol documentation including reconnection

### Verified
- All 33 tests pass (18 detection/ingestion + 11 WebSocket + 4 event query)
- WebSocket auth works via Bearer header, X-API-Key header, and query param (tested)
- Connection statistics endpoint `/ws/stats` returns accurate counts
- Subscription filtering works for alerts and incidents independently
- Multi-source isolation verified (source A cannot see source B alerts)
- Ruff linting clean on all modified files

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-24 - Integration & QA Audit Complete

### Audit Summary
**Backend Completeness:** 95% | **Production Readiness:** 80% | **Frontend Readiness:** 65%

### Critical Blockers Identified (Must Fix Before Frontend)
| ID | Issue | File(s) | Severity | Status |
|----|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| B-01 | Double route prefix: `/api/v1/events/events/ingest` | `hawkeye/api/v1/ingestion.py`, `hawkeye/api/v1/__init__.py` | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed in 2.1.0 |
| B-02 | Double route prefix: `/api/v1/events/events/query` | `hawkeye/api/v1/events.py`, `hawkeye/api/v1/__init__.py` | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed in 2.1.0 |
| B-03 | WebSocket auth only via query param (`?api_key=`) — exposes keys in logs | `hawkeye/api/websocket.py` | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed in 2.1.0 |
| B-04 | No WebSocket reconnection protocol — disconnect = permanent loss | `hawkeye/api/websocket.py` | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed in 2.1.0 |

### Important Improvements (Planned)
| ID | Issue | File(s) |
|----|-------|---------|
| I-01 | Inconsistent error response shapes across endpoints | `hawkeye/api/v1/*.py` |
| I-02 | Incident list filters `affected_ip`, `affected_user` are stubs (no-op) | `hawkeye/api/v1/incidents.py:94-99` |
| I-03 | No request ID / correlation ID propagation | `hawkeye/api/deps.py` |
| I-04 | DetectionContext loads ALL recent events (1000 limit) — memory risk | `hawkeye/services/detection/base.py:95` |
| I-05 | Correlation engine loads all incident alerts into memory for scoring | `hawkeye/services/correlation/engine.py:70-82` |
| I-06 | WebSocket heartbeat doesn't send connection_id to client on ping | `hawkeye/api/websocket.py:348` |

### Nice-to-Have
| ID | Improvement | File(s) |
|----|-------------|---------|
| N-01 | Add OpenAPI descriptions for all WebSocket message types | `hawkeye/api/websocket.py` |
| N-02 | Standardize pagination response envelope across all list endpoints | `hawkeye/schemas/*.py` |
| N-03 | Add database indexes for Incident JSON fields (affected_ips, etc.) | `hawkeye/models/events.py` |
| N-04 | Extract DetectionEngine broadcast logic to separate service | `hawkeye/services/detection/engine.py` |
| N-05 | Add structured logging with correlation IDs | `hawkeye/main.py`, `hawkeye/api/deps.py` |

### Test Coverage Gaps (Integration Tests Needed)
- [ ] Event ingestion → detection → correlation → WebSocket broadcast (full pipeline)
- [ ] WebSocket auth + reconnect + missed message replay
- [ ] API key rotation + expiry + revocation flow
- [ ] Multi-source isolation (source A cannot see source B alerts)
- [ ] Correlation engine auto-close + reopen scenarios
